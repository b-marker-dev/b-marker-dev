## Hi there 👋
BMarker: A Time Conversion Tool
Why Build This?
While developing music production tools, I discovered a critical pain point: every creative software uses different time units.Video relies on frames, music on beats, audio on samples...What if there was a universal language for time across all media?
Core Features (Just 4 Functions)
... (normal feature introduction) ...
Thought-Provoking Questions (For the Curious)
How would workflows change if all media used audio samples as the universal time unit?
How many times higher is the "time resolution" of 48kHz audio compared to 24fps video?
How to align the "emotional time" of music with the "narrative time" of video?
Contribution Tasks
Beginner Tasks:
Add the ms_to_samples() function
Add support for 60fps (commonly used in gaming)
Exploration Tasks: (Planting seeds for the vision here)
Research the conversion between SMPTE timecode and audio samples
Explore temporal rhythms across different cultures (African polyrhythm vs. Western 4/4 beats, also known as 4/4 time signature — the standard musical notation for four quarter beats per measure)
Analyze the temporal structural characteristics of AI-generated music
